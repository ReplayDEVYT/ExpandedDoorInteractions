<p>This is my first client mod! Please report any bugs you encounter in the comments.</p>
<h3>
	Expanded Door Interactions
</h3>
<h2>
	What is it?
</h2>
<p>This mod adds more options to choose from when interacting with (almost) any door in the game, like peeking.</p>
<h2>
	What features does it come with?
</h2>
<p>Right now, only peeking is added. Peeking allows you to open a door about 3x less than normal, letting you get a look into the other room without immediately exposing yourself. You can use the gap or the door to throw/bounce grenades into the room while keeping yourself safe.</p>
<p>More features like stealth door opening are planned.</p>

<h3>
	This mod uses modified code from <a href="https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1660-open-sesame/#overview">Open Sesame</a>, as I did not know how to write the code myself due to me having no prior experience with client modding.
